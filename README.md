A **mobile-first**, touch-friendly Pokémon mini-game for children ages **5–7**. Sibling project to [pokemon-search-app](https://github.com/Elli2022/pokemon-search-app).

Kids match **picture cards only** — no reading required. A curated roster (Pikachu, Charmander, Eevee, and friends) avoids random obscure species names.

## Live demo

**[Play on Netlify](https://pokemon-kids-playground.netlify.app/)**

## Game modes

| Mode | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Memory** | 12 cards, 6 pairs. Flip two at a time until all matches are found. |
| **Adventure trail** | Five stops on a path. Each stop has a 4-card mini memory (2 pairs). Clear a stop to move the buddy forward. |

## In-app highlights

Blue status pills in the header:

`PokeAPI` · `Netlify` · `Ages 5–7` · `Touch-ready`

## Mobile & touch

Built **mobile-first**, then enhanced for larger screens:

- 3-column memory grid on phones, 4 columns from `36rem` up
- Minimum **48×48px** tap targets (tabs, cards, buttons)
- `touch-action: manipulation` and reduced tap highlight flash
- `pointerup` handlers with debounce to avoid double-flips on touch
- `safe-area-inset` padding for notched devices
- `100dvh` layout and horizontal scroll on the trail when needed
